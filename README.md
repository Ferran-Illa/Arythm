# Arythm
Multiscale models for a first approach to the modelling of electrical impulses in the heart. These simulations are mainly focused towards the understanding of the alternance phenomenon, spiraling (tachychardia), and spiral breaking (fibrillation). The model is brought from a single-cell perspective to 1D and ultimately 2D matrixes of cells, coupled by diffusion.
